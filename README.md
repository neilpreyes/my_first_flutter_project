With the increase of students choosing to live off-campus to save money, the need to have an aid that can differentiate good and bad housing has grown in popularity.
The time where the only way to see if a place is a proper living environment was to sign a lease and hope for the best is no more.
This app will allow users to rate and search for house/apartment listings that have been previously occupied by other students in order to find appropriate housing options.


## How To

- The user will first be given the option to register or sign in, accordingly
  - Either one prompts the user to input an email and a password
- Upon inputting the correct information, the user is loaded into the Home Page
- The Home Page allows the user to see all available listings, search through them, and create a listing
- Additionally, the user has the option to Log Out on the Home Page
